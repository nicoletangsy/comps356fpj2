(2, 'Treating diabetes takes more than insulin: Senegal mobile phone project promoting public health', 'Every morning, mother of six Mariama rises early to sell fish in her local market in Senegal. For the past decade, she has lived with diabetes, and takes insulin regularly. But her medication is not the only tool she relies on to look after her health – her mobile phone plays a critical part of her diabetes control regimen.\r\n\r\nThanks to Senegal''s mDiabetes programme during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan this year, Mariama has found it easier to cope with the condition and have the energy needed to work and care for her family. “These messages really help me manage my condition,” she says. They have also allowed her family to actively engage in her care.\r\n\r\n“Every day I would ask my son to check if there was a new message,” Mariama adds. “He would help me understand what I needed to do to stay healthy and control my diabetes, and we would then talk about it together.”\r\n\r\nThe role of the mobile\r\n\r\nInformation and communications technology, or ICTs, especially the mobile phone, are changing expectations around access to health information. Mobile phones can support diabetes prevention by providing simple tips on good management or prevention, usually around diet, exercise and checking for signs of complications such as diabetic foot complications.\r\n\r\nSince 2013, WHO has been working with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to help countries like Senegal introduce large-scale mDiabetes services using mobile phones. The joint initiative, Be He@lthy, Be Mobile, works to design, deploy and scale up prevention and management services for diabetes and a number of other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).\r\n\r\nDiabetes was one of Be He@lthy, Be Mobile''s first major programmes. The initiative has created a global handbook to help countries introduce large-scale services, including content for the SMS messages and support for other areas such as technology, promotion and evaluation.\r\n\r\nUsing SMS to deliver advice to patients speeds up the diffusion of information to help people manage or prevent the disease. This reduces prevalence and treatment costs, and helps patients live longer, healthier lives.\r\n\r\nA global perspective\r\n\r\nDiabetes continues to be a serious public health challenge. Since 1980 the number of people with diabetes has increased four-fold to 422 million, and in 2015 an estimated 1.6 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes. This does not account for the additional impact of high blood glucose, which causes around 2 million deaths annually by increasing the risk of cardiovascular and kidney disease and tuberculosis. Poorly controlled diabetes aggravates the risk of debilitating and costly complications, such as blindness, kidney failure, heart disease and stroke, and lower limb amputations.\r\n\r\nSenegal was the first country to launch a targeted mDiabetes campaign in 2014 to help people manage fasting during Ramadan. This has now become an annual service, and saw over 100 000 registrations in 2017.\r\n\r\nBut other countries are quickly following suit. In July 2016 the initiative launched an mDiabetes service in India which currently supports over 96 000 users. It also runs annual campaigns in Egypt to help people with diabetes manage fasting during Ramadan. The 2017 campaign there reached over 175 000 people.\r\n\r\nFrom information to action\r\n\r\nOne of the service''s key lessons learned to date is the importance of making recommendations on diabetes management easy for patients to follow.\r\n\r\n“It is important to frame facts in a way which encourages people to apply what they have learnt, in order for them to adopt new behaviours,” says Dr Douglas Bettcher, Director of WHO''s Department for the Prevention of NCDs, which runs the Be He@lthy, Be Mobile initiative. “By providing information in a format which is simple and action-oriented, it is easier for subscribers to incorporate the information into their daily routines and make positive changes in their diet, exercise and habits.”\r\n\r\nIt is also a key step in moving towards patient empowerment. By giving people the right information at the right time, they can take charge of their condition in between contacts with their doctor or health worker. For chronic diseases this is essential to improve quality of life and treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nDr Prebo Barango, WHO''s focal point for the Be He@lthy, Be Mobile initiative in Africa, explains that better knowledge from the mDiabetes programme is impacting the way doctors support patients. “The programme has changed the format of medical consultations,” Dr Barango says. “Doctors ask their patients if they have received the SMS messages, and which ones they need more information about to make sure they understand what it means. The dialogue is more constructive.”\r\n\r\nFor Mariama, the benefit is clear. A programme which started as a simple six-week service has changed the way she manages her diabetes for good. “Thanks to the messages, I understand that I constantly need to pay attention to what and when I eat,” she says.', 'Every morning, mother of six Mariama rises early to sell fish in her local market in Senegal.

(3, 'Phone addiction could ruin your health', 'Cell phones, and even more so smartphones, are incredible devices that keep us entertained and connected to our social networks. But with more and more people using cell phones world over, phone addiction is also emerging as a problem. These mini computers have eliminated our need for alarm clocks, address books, notepads and cameras.\r\n\r\nThese benefits, however, come with a downside as they seem to come with several disadvantages. Because of its extensive impact on daily life, some new terms were invented in popular culture to describe this problem, such as, nomophobia, short for ï¿½no-mobile-phone phobia, or smartphone zombie.\r\n\r\nRachna Pande, an internal medicine specialist, says although it is not yet included in the diagnostic and statistical manual, overuse of phones has been considered as an addiction akin to gambling.\r\n\r\nSome of the major signs and symptoms of smartphone addiction, according to Pande, include the need to use the cell phone more and more often in order to achieve the same desired effect, persistent failed attempts to use cell phone less often, preoccupation with smartphone use and turning to the cell phone when experiencing unwanted feelings such as anxiety or depression.\r\n\r\nOther signs of phone addiction include, excessive use characterised by loss of sense of time, putting a job or relationship at risk due to cell phone use, urge to have latest versions of cell phones, feeling of anxiety when a cell phone or network is not available, as well as feelings of anger, irritability or depression, neck pain and digital eye strain resulting from using the cell phone.\r\n\r\nHow phones are becoming hazardous\r\n\r\nSeveral studies conducted overtime reveal that the overuse of mobile phones may come with profound implications on mental, physical, social health wellbeing.\r\n\r\nThe overuse of smartphone can lead to a series of problems. Studies have shown that, excessive smartphone use is associated with depression and anxiety disorders.\r\n\r\nAccording to Celestine Karangwa, a physiotherapist at TCM Technology Clinic in Kigali, chronic slouching over oneï¿½s phone for hours can ruin their neck, ears and hurt their back muscles, as well as cause migraines.\r\n\r\nResearch done in New York University has validated that too much screen time can be problematic for people with migraine. While itï¿½s hopefully just a small headache, a migraine is usually recurring and severe enough to make you feel nauseous or sensitive to light.\r\n\r\nï¿½Looking down at your phone can add up to 60 pounds of pressure on your spine, depending on the angle. Tilting your head forward puts a strain on your neck and back which results in a permanently disturbed posture and puts a lot of stress on your neck, shoulder, and cervical spine, which can turn into chronic back pain in the long run,ï¿½ the research says.\r\n\r\nThe study also found that people bend their necks at around 45 degrees, when they use their phones and it becomes even worse as they sit, versus standing. The impact on the spine increases at higher flexed postures.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel Nkusi, a neurosurgeon at King Faisal Hospital, Kigali, defines posture as a dynamic pattern of reflexes, habits and adaptive responses to anything that resists you being more or less upright and functional.\r\n\r\nï¿½The spine is the basis of posture. If your posture is bad, your spine can be misaligned. Spinal misalignments may cause interference in nerve function,ï¿½ he says.\r\n\r\nCell phones might also be hazardous to our sleep, with the latest evidence suggesting that individuals with smartphones in the bedroom sleep less each night.\r\n\r\nThe reason, according to Daniel Gahungu, a general practitioner at Polyclinique de Iï¿½Etoile in Kigali, is that phone-related activities stimulate our brains and keep us alert, as the type of light emitted by most modern phones and influence over our sleep patterns.\r\n\r\nï¿½When we use our phones during bedtime, we realise consciously that it is time to sleep. Our bodies however absorb the blue light emitted by screens and this can confuse the daily sleep-wake cycle which we are used to, leading us to feel wide awake when we should be sleeping,ï¿½ he says.\r\n\r\nMobile phones, he further explains emit blue light that the brain may interpret as daylight. The blue light suppresses melatonin which is a hormone that prepares one for sleep and as a result, the brain feels stimulated.\r\n\r\nKarangwa also says many people are unaware of the harmful electromoblie magnetic radiation (EMR) that comes with mobile phones, which can be hazardous to the ears and brain. The EMR radiation may cause DNA damage, brain dysfunction and hearing impairments.\r\n\r\nIn addition, radiation from cell phones can reduce sperm vitality and count in males. Phones are carriers of different microbes as well, hence contaminated phones can cause diarrhoeal diseases, skin infections, boils and even life threatening infections. Using cell phones while driving can cause accidents similar to drunk driving.\r\n\r\nPreventing the health risks\r\n\r\nOver usage of mobile devices may be hazardous but can sometimes be inevitable. Health experts recommend appropriate phone usage to avoid health risks.\r\n\r\nKarangwa advises that while making or receiving calls, phones should be put in loud speaker or ear phones used. This he says will prevent direct contact of the phone with the ears hence avoid transmitting radiation.\r\n\r\nPande also advises that a close friend or family member should be aware of the signs and recognise them if the individual displays them.\r\n\r\nï¿½An individual addicted to cell phone use needs counselling to get rid of this addiction. They should be told about the physical and mental hazards, as well as the need for improving human contact. They should be weaned away from the telephone starting from say an hour daily and increasing the time gradually. It is important to keep them engaged in other activities so that the mind is diverted away from the phone. Yoga and meditation help one to improve self-determination and can help him to overcome this addiction,ï¿½ she says.\r\n\r\nIncreasing font size according to Gahungu, is a simple yet effective trick to make content on the screen easier to read. This can help reduce the likelihood of eyestrain, which can be a trigger for migraine attacks.\r\n\r\nA more practical recommendation, he adds, would be frequent rest breaks or some physical exercise that can strengthen the neck and shoulder muscles. ï¿½Phone users should try to hold their phones at least 16 inches away from their faces. Every few minutes look up from your screen at something far away for short breaks, and donï¿½t forget to blink.ï¿½', 'Cell phones, and even more so smartphones, are incredible devices that keep us entertained and connected to our social networks.

(4, 'The Dangers of Driving While Distracted!', 'Five-year-old Moriah Modisette died one Christmas Eve after a distracted driver plowed into the back of her familyï¿½s car on a Texas highway, according to police reports.\r\n\r\nGarrett Wilhelm, 20 at the time, was accused of video chatting on his smartphone when traffic ahead of him slowed. The police say he didnï¿½t notice and slammed into the Modisettesï¿½ car at full speed. The force of the collision caused the car to spin, coming to rest facing the wrong direction in traffic.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was airlifted to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, says the police report of the 2014 incident. Her older sister, Isabella, 8, who was sitting next to her in the backseat, survived, as did her mother, Bethany, who was in the front passenger seat of the Toyota Camry. Moriahï¿½s father, James, in the driverï¿½s seat, was knocked unconscious and spared seeing the events that led to his daughterï¿½s death.\r\n\r\nWilhelm has a manslaughter charge pending against him because of the crash, in which his Toyota 4Runner landed in the highway median. A police officer found the video call still running on Wilhelmï¿½s iPhone.\r\n\r\nThe Modisettes didnï¿½t want to be interviewed for this article, but Greg Love, a lawyer for the family, spoke with CR. ï¿½Bethany and Moriahï¿½s older sister, Isabella, were conscious and perceived everything that happened inside that car,ï¿½ he said. Love also pointed out that at the time of the accident, there was no state ban in Texas on texting while driving. In May 2017 the first statewide distracted-driving law in the state was passed, and it took effect in September. It prohibits all texting and ï¿½electronic messagingï¿½ while driving.\r\n\r\nDangerous Choices\r\nThe latest statistics show that Americaï¿½s traffic deaths are rising. There are many reasons, including the fact that weï¿½re driving more miles. But some experts say that the marriage of automobiles and smartphones (with their growing menu of apps) is contributing to the danger, even for pedestrians and cyclists. Despite a decade of new laws and enforcement, and a flurry of public-safety campaigns, surveys have found that drivers still make the dangerous choice to text and drive or use their smartphones in other distracting ways.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a nationally representative survey by Consumer Reports in October 2017 found that 41 percent of drivers with smartphones said they had used their hands to text while driving, and 8 percent admitted to watching a video on their phone while driving.\r\n\r\nThe Modisettes sued Apple, accusing the company of being at fault because it hadnï¿½t sufficiently warned people not to use its FaceTime app while driving. (The app allows video-to-video communication with another person also on an Apple smart device.) A judge threw out the case in May, ruling that the user of a smartphone is responsible for unsafe behavior, not the manufacturer. The case is on appeal.\r\n\r\nTraffic fatalities on U.S. roads in 2016 increased to 37,461, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Thatï¿½s a 5.6 percent increase over 2015, after an 8.4 percent increase in 2014.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, 3,450 people were killed because of distracted driving, a 2.2 percent decline from 2015. Still, the number of distraction-related fatalities reported in 2016 was higher than in 2011. According to NHTSA, fatal distracted-driving crashes specifically involving cell-phone use increased to 14 percent (442) in 2015 from 12 percent (354) in 2011. And the percentage of distracted-driving-related crashes resulting in injuries that were linked to cell phones increased to 8 percent (21,000) in 2015 from 6 percent (15,000) in 2011. (A breakdown from NHTSA for 2016 isnï¿½t available yet.) Even these numbers donï¿½t fully reflect the potential scope of danger, safety advocates and the police say, because of the limits of law enforcement and the lack of adequate evidence proving that smartphone use or other distractions were the root cause of some crashes.\r\n\r\nDistracted driving has also involved in-car infotainment systems and lower-tech driver activity, such as adjusting a radio or temperature control, talking to a passenger, or taking eyes off the road for any reason.\r\n\r\nThe automotive and tech industries are using technology designed to mitigate distracted-driving dangers. Many new vehicles have advanced safety features (often optional) such as automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist, which are recognized for their potential to help protect drivers and passengers.\r\n\r\nMajor smartphone manufacturers, wireless providers, and smaller tech companies have created various apps and services to prevent teens and adults from using smartphones while driving. But at the moment, the adoption and use of them rely largely on users choosing to opt in.\r\n\r\nAnd until cars become fully autonomous, dangers will persist from those who choose to use smartphones while driving or become distracted by onboard infotainment systems.\r\n\r\nï¿½Unfortunately, in the short term, we actually could see greater risks because we will have a mix of autonomous, semi-autonomous, and manually driven cars,ï¿½ says Deborah Hersman, president and CEO of the National Safety Council. ï¿½The transition is going to be a little bit of a messy middle.ï¿½\r\n\r\nThe Rise of Connected Cars\r\nGeneral Motors first introduced its OnStar in-car connectivity in 1996. And the company claims it became the first automaker to introduce 4G LTE wireless across its entire retail platform in 2014. Since then, Chevrolet has sold nearly 2.5 million 4G OnStar LTE-connected vehicles.\r\n\r\nThese cellular connections power onboard WiFi hot spots that can be used by up to seven digital devices in a single vehicle.\r\n\r\nCarmakers are adding high-speed internet connections and designing more sophisticated interfaces to serve customer demand for constant connectivity. But theyï¿½re also working closely with Silicon Valley to integrate smartphones more deeply into the driving experience. Almost every automaker is now building Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support into new vehicles. These systems serve up a simplified smartphone-style interface on a dashboard screen, giving drivers the apps, controls, and voice assistants theyï¿½re already familiar with.\r\n\r\nAutomakers say theyï¿½re doing their best to balance the desire for technology with safe design. A Ford spokeswoman said in an email response to questions that it has ï¿½prioritized voice recognition as the interface for smartphone control while driving,ï¿½ because research ï¿½indicates that helping drivers keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road is the most important factor in minimizing distractions.ï¿½\r\n\r\nA Toyota spokesman said in an email that customers want the company to ï¿½evolve and keep up with the latestï¿½ technology. He added that Toyota considers driver distraction during product development: ï¿½As part of our basic design processes, Toyota considers how all the systems we integrate into our vehicles will be used in the driving environment, with the goals of helping to optimize interactions with the driver while avoiding distractions.ï¿½\r\n\r\nAt GM, as each infotainment feature is developed, engineers test and measure driver attention using a simulator, says Mike Hichme, the companyï¿½s executive director of user experience. ï¿½We measure their eye movements,ï¿½ he explains. ï¿½They canï¿½t have glances of longer than 2 seconds away from the road for any one task.ï¿½\r\n\r\nIf the test shows that a driver is confused by touch-screen controls or voice commands, the function is locked out after a certain period. Streaming video, game apps, web browsing, and social media messaging are prohibited on the touch screen, Hichme says.', 'Five-year-old Moriah Modisette died one Christmas Eve after a distracted driver plowed into the back of her family’s car on a Texas highway, according to police reports.', '', 0, '2017-11-24 00:00:00', 'Accident');

It then crossed the ramp of the recovery truck before striking another vehicle a glancing blow before it came to rest.''\r\n\r\nThe barrister said that to convict the defendant the jury must believe his driving that day had fallen far below that expected by a careful and competent driver.\r\n\r\n''So why does the prosecution say that the driving of Mr Morrison was dangerous rather than simply careless?'' said Mr Gibson.\r\n\r\nHe then outlined the prosecution case: that the defendant had driven past six motorway sings displaying advisory 50mph speed signs before the accident happened.\r\n\r\nHe also drove past a sign warning that there was been an accident just after Junction 38, the jury heard.\r\n\r\n''The prosecution say that he ignored all of those signs and the reason, we say, is that between a few miles south of Carlisle and the point of the collision he had been driving at an average speed of 81mph - some 30mph above the advisory speed limit.\r\n\r\n''Had he seen this signs, why had he not taken any notice of them?\r\n\r\n''The prosecution say that the reason is that he was distracted was concentrating on something else other than his driving, or the road conditions and the road.''\r\n\r\nWhat distracted the defendant, said Mr Gibson, was his use of a mobile phone to send text messages throughout this part of his journey south.\r\n\r\n''The last message the sent before the collision was 96 seconds before it; and the last message he received was some 45 seconds before the collision.\r\n\r\n''Those messages were part of an ongoing text conversation he had been having with a number of people.''\r\n\r\nThus, said the barrister, it was a perfectly reasonable inference that the defendant had been concentrating on his phone rather than his driving as he approached the scene of the earlier accident.\r\n\r\nThe barrister then outlined comments from a number of other people who were travelling along the M6 that day and say the defendant''s Mercedes ml 4x4 as Morrison drove past them.\r\n\r\nDavid Brown, who was driving a Honda car with his two children as his passengers, said he noticed the Mercedes 4x4 overtake his car.', 'Peter Morrison is accused of causing the death of a Cumbrian highways officer in a crash that left another man paralysed.', '$image5', 0, '2017-11-15 19:20:17', 'Accident');

More and more, Google is ranking websites according to UX (user experience), so if your mobile site provides a poor user experience, you can expect your Google ranking to drop. Thatï¿½s bad news for you and great news for your mobile-optimized competitors.\r\nMake sure your website is fast-loading on mobile with an easy-to-read landing page and intuitive interaction for mobile users. Remember that mobile users are on the go, so they wonï¿½t want to be tapping out information on lengthy forms. If your desktop website has a long form, shorten it for the mobile site to make it more user-friendly.\r\nUse text for appointment reminders\r\nIf your staff are still calling patients and leaving voice messages with appointment reminders, pay attention. The average voicemail response rate is a dismal 4.8%. Many people donï¿½t even bother checking their voicemail these days, but they read text messages.\r\nLetï¿½s take a look at the real example: The Canyon Creek Dental team wanted to reduce dental office no-shows and decided to adopt text as a solution. Owner Mary Higgins says texting works. ï¿½Patients like being reminded by text,ï¿½ she said. ï¿½It is unobtrusive and we can text several times a day and they donï¿½t feel like weï¿½re nagging them. They can confirm or cancel easily. Our patients are showing up for their appointments. They will forget a morning phone call, but a text stays with them.ï¿½\r\nTexting is a time-saver too. Instead of calling patients one by one, a bulk text with personalized reminders can be sent out with one click.\r\nAdopt an app\r\nApps can enhance efficiency, from scheduling appointments to follow-up to mobile payments. The best part is that apps collect all the essential information in one place. You can easily reference patient history through an app, and patients can use it to refer friends or family members to your practice.\r\nHere are a few more things that are helpful about apps:\r\nï¿½ Apps make it easy for patients to schedule an appointment, freeing up your staff from having to answer phone calls and manage a schedule.\r\nï¿½ Itï¿½s possible to allow patients to pay through the app, making it easy to track accounting and send automated reminders to patients about upcoming payments due.\r\nï¿½ Patients can fill out forms through the app and practitioners can text them relevant post-care information.\r\nï¿½ Offices can advertise specials, such as discounts on teeth cleaning, with push notifications.\r\nEnhance patient care\r\nMobile can help enhance follow-up treatment. The exchange of photos and videos via mobile improves patient careï¿½it reduces the need for patients to come back to the office to collect results. Patients can have access to their records via their phone and read messages sent from the dentist at their leisure.\r\nPatients can also ask questions they may not have thought about when they were in the office, and dental staff can reply as theyï¿½re available. Mobile makes practitioners more accessible to patients and allows for more thorough care and communication.\r\nA word about HIPPA and HITECH\r\nWhile thereï¿½s no doubt that mobile is the future of health and dental care, all of these rapid technological advances have left practitioners without a clear picture of how to provide care without jeopardizing patient privacy. In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) was introduced, putting the onus on dental practitioners to develop systems of storing patient data that protects patients.\r\nIn 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) was introduced to enforce compliance among practitioners. There are some steps that can help protect you and your practice.\r\nFor example, consider hiring an information protection service as common storage. Sharing applications such as Dropbox and GoogleDrive are not secure and not approved by HIPPAA. Also, make sure your passcodes are between seven and 10 digits and accessible only to authorized staff.\r\nFrom increasing conversions, reducing no-shows, enhancing patient care, and executing patient communication from the convenience of an app, mobile offers many of benefits to dental practitioners and patients. Adopt it today and youï¿½ll be happy in the future!', 'The future is here. People depend on their mobile devices for so many things, such as finding a new dentist or communicating with their dentist online. Mobile-friendly websites and communicating via text are just two of the many mobile practices that will help your practice thrive.', '', 0, '2017-11-01 00:00:00', 'Patients'),

And a study from Deloitte, conducted by Ipsos MORI, found that to be the case.\r\n\r\nAccording to the survey, which polled 2,000 US internet users ages 18 to 75, most people check their device approximately 47 times per day. And younger users? Well, they tend to check it with a significantly higher frequency—roughly 86 times a day. That’s an increase from the 82 times per day reported in 2016.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, nearly nine in 10 respondents said they check their phone within an hour of waking up in the morning, and almost as many do so right before they go to sleep.

Even if I’m not expecting a message and know that everyone I was talking to is currently busy, it’s likely I’ll still neurotically check my phone every few minutes just in case.\r\n\r\nTurns out I’m not alone in my mobile addiction.\r\n\r\nA study from Deloitte of 2,000 U.S. internet users aged 18 to 75 found most people check their smartphone roughly 47 times a day.\r\n\r\nYounger users nearly double this stat, checking their devices around 86 times a day, up from 82 times reported in the 2016 study.\r\n\r\nThe study also assessed which activities drove users to check their smartphones. Patterns of use compared to the previous year remain relatively unchanged except for self-reports of checking the phone while driving, which has fortunately decreased.\r\n\r\nMore than nine out of every ten respondents confess they use their phone while shopping or “spending leisure time.” Over eight out of ten reported checking on phones while watching TV, eating in a restaurant, and even while talking to family and friends.\r\n\r\nWhen watching a show that’s longer than eleven minutes, I put my phone on the opposite side of the room if I want any hope of paying attention. I know if I keep my phone next to me, I’ll miss crucial chunks of episodes. This is a partial attempt to manage the addiction.\r\n\r\nLikewise, around 47 percent of respondents said they’re trying to limit their usage, and are actively taking steps to reduce time spent on their phones. Some people report success by simply keeping their phones out of sight, turning it off during meals, or while spending time with friends.\r\n\r\nA third of those surveyed turn off audio notifications, while around a quarter even went as far as putting some apps the chopping block. Another quarter could only part with their phones at bed time, turning their devices off at night.\r\n\r\nHaving a smartphone is fun (an addiction), but you don’t want to end up being that sad woman in the “Selfie” episode of High Maintenance only interacting with your phone.\r\n\r\nSometimes it can be much healthier to just put your phone away for a while.

A Chennai-based entrepreneur has developed a mobile application ‘Knownets’ that allows parents to keep a tab on their children and especially the amount of time they spend with electronic gadgets.\r\n\r\nThe mobile application, which is available on Google Play Store that can be downloaded on any Android smartphone, would serve as a solution to save the younger generation from nomophobia (No Mobile Phobia) at a time when the hazardous Blue Whale game, mobile addiction and anxiety are claiming their lives.\r\n\r\nThe new application helps parents to control the duration and usage of mobile phones by their children and track their location precisely.\r\n\r\n“Nowadays adolescent children spend more time with their smartphones. With fast and cheap Internet available, they are exposed to unwanted content and websites. Parents are not able to regulate their children.\r\n\r\nOver-usage of mobile phones leads to change in sleeping patterns, anxiety, depression, isolation and more problems among them”, R Sachidanandam, creator of ‘Knownets’, told Deccan Chronicle.  \r\n\r\nThe electronics and communications engineer says that parents can control their children''s mobile phone at the touch of their smartphone.\r\n\r\n“If a parent wants his son to go to bed at a particular time, he can lock the phone from his phone. The application will link the parent''s mobile to the child''s mobile. Further, the phone will lock automatically according to the time that has been set”.\r\n\r\n“Also, a parent can monitor where his child goes, as the app will send notification of the location every 15 minutes. This feature will work regardless of whether the data (internet) in the child''s phone is turned on or not”, he added.\r\n\r\nSachidanandam says he also faced stiff opposition from his children when he began monitoring their phones. At first, every child will fight with parents to uninstall but after a few days, they would be accustomed to the new routine. But the end result will help the child to get away from nomophobia, he said.\r\n\r\n“Due to Google''s privacy policy, the app would not spy on children about what they are watching or to whom they are speaking. But a parent can control the duration of usage. If schools persuade children into using this application, children will not throw tantrums at homes”, he urged.\r\n\r\nWhat is ‘nomophobia’?\r\n\r\nNo Mobile Phobia (Nomophobia) is being scared of losing the use of mobile phone due to absence of signal or running out of minutes/ battery power . It leads to insomnia and change in sleeping patterns, anxiety, depression, restlessness, reduced academic or work performance, isolation from family, poor memory and inactive mind. ‘Nomophobia’ also causes early spinal cord and back pain problems.', 'The new application helps parents to control the duration and usage of mobile phones by their children and track their location precisely.', '$image10', 0, '2017-11-08 07:26:27', 'Mobile addiction');

(11, 'Do not be Cellfish (and Other Mobile Device Etiquette You Should be Following)', 'We have all been there. Everyone is sitting around and talking quietly, maybe eating, maybe studying, maybe trying to get some work done. Then out of nowhere, someoneï¿½s phone rings, and instead of getting up and taking their phone outside, they proceed to take the call, and speak loudly, right there in the midst of everyone. Nobody wants to hear the details of your personal life, or about your medical problems, dude. Take it outsideï¿½ quietly.\r\n\r\nTo avoid being that person, you might want to observe the following rules of cell phone etiquette:\r\n\r\nTake it outside. Nobody wants to hear your side of the phone call. If youï¿½re out in the desert or forest with nobody around, you take that call. Thereï¿½s nobody out there to annoy but some pronghorns or some squirrels. But if youï¿½re near a fixed group of people, be considerate and remove yourself from the group. Your colleagues, friends, and/or the people nearby will thank you.\r\nBe quiet. Along the lines of being considerate is being quiet. If you do take a call and donï¿½t remove yourself from the room, at least make your voice as low as possible. Walking through a public space, itï¿½s perfectly acceptable to take your phone calls. But we donï¿½t want to hear your conversation from three aisles over in the grocery store.\r\nLeave it. Unless someoneï¿½s dying or giving birth, is that text so important that you have to interrupt the person youï¿½re spending time with to check your messages? This is especially true when youï¿½re out with someone. You immediately devalue the person youï¿½re with when you check your phone or scan through your Facebook news feed when youï¿½re with them. (That being said, there are situations when itï¿½s perfectly fine to be on your phone when youï¿½re with someone.) But, for the love of God, please donï¿½t check your phone or scroll through your Instagram while youï¿½re on a date. Nothing screams ï¿½youï¿½re not interesting enoughï¿½ than to be more interested in what your latest notification says than what your date is saying. RUDE.\r\nThink twiceï¿½ and maybe a third time also. We live in an age of connectivity. Not only wireless connectivity, but of social network connectivity. Our online personas are just as real and representative of who we are as our real-life personas. So when youï¿½re out with someone and want to post about it, think twiceï¿½ or maybe three times about tagging them. Now more than ever, current and potential employers are using social media to research job applicants and existing employees. Think, would you want your boss to see that picture of you? If that was you in the picture, would you want to be tagged? This is not only a liability with personal relationships, but itï¿½s also one in professional circles as well. Just remember, keep it classy, folks. If you donï¿½t think your boss or grandma would approve, donï¿½t tag it.\r\nSilent & vibrate modes were created for a reason. In school, at work, at the theater, in a restaurant, on a date, in a meeting, during the nightï¿½ the list of places where people donï¿½t want to hear your device ringing or bleeping goes on. Besides it being rude, itï¿½s just annoying. And inconsiderate. And rude.\r\nLet private information remain private. Donï¿½t forward a secret that someone just shared with you, so you and your friends can snicker over it or make fun of that person. A photo meant for private viewing should not be sent on for your friends to enjoy too. When in doubtï¿½ donï¿½t share. NOTE: There are popular ephemeral messaging apps, like Snapchat, where the message ï¿½disappearsï¿½ after viewing. Screenshots happen. If you donï¿½t explicitly trust that person, even on a non-permanent app, sending highly personal information and photos might not be the best idea.\r\nDid anyone notice a pattern there? What was the common theme in all of those etiquette points? In case you missed it, Iï¿½ll spell it out for you: 1) Be considerate, and 2) Donï¿½t be rude. \r\n\r\n', 'Weï¿½ve all been there.
